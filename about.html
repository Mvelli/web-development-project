    <h2>About Web Development</h2>
    
    <p>
        Web development refers to the process of building and maintaining websites.
        It involves different tasks such as web design, coding, content creation,
        and performance optimization.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        There are two main areas of web development:
    </p>
    
    <h3>Frontend Development</h3>
    <p>
        Frontend development focuses on the part of the website that users see
        and interact with. It involves technologies such as HTML for structure,
        CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Backend Development</h3>
    <p>
        Backend development handles the server-side operations of a website.
        It manages databases, servers, and application logic to ensure that
        the website functions correctly.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Web development is important because it enables individuals and
        organizations to share information, offer services, and reach a
        global audience through the internet.
